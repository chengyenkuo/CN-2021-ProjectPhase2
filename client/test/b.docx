China is known for its long history of traditional art forms, including the art of paper-cutting. The traditional art can be found mainly in Mandarin-speaking regions around the world, especially in the rural areas of China.Paper-cutting was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).However, it is a dying craft as most young Chinese are choosing other forms of profession and entertainment over paper-cutting.To prevent that from happening, paper-cutting master Tu Yonghong has devoted her life to the creation of paper-cuttings and even founded the Xi An Ding Yi Paper-cutting Society in 2003 to encourage the public to take up the art.
